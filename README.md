# ClickCon

Current online version: down for maintenance, will have one again soon!

Simple ish turn-based game where the objective is to have as many points as possible by the time the turn limit is reached.

Written in JS, used JS to generate the UI for the game too. Uses JS canvas for the interactive game, includes bot players as well.

## More in depth:

ClickCon began as a tinkering experiment to figure out how to do proximity for another board game. Started on August 28th, 2017, it's been my longest project and possibly my favourite, and it's still going.

ClickCon has been my learning project for everything I know about JavaScript so far, and I plan to continue learning even and evolve the game as I go.

I plan to add online multiplayer soon too, once I get a better grasp on how Node.js works.
